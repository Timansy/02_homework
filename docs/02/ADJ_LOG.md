# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The goal of this assignment was to build a fully responsive website consisting of 3 pages that each had a nav bar, utilized a responsive layout with responsive images. Below is a review of requirements and how I tackled each.

## Review

Using the following three pages, build a portfolio site. `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

*I started with the index page and worked element by element on down until I had something that worked for me. The design was clean and once the various videos and reading began to sink in - I began to enjoy it.*

*The most helpful video I found was [from Drew Ryan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cKsq14Kfsw*). You can see that I included a lot of the elements he did adding and subtracting a few.*

Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items: A navbar, A responsive layout, Responsive images

*There were a couple of really cool things I got to learn about here.*

1. *The jumbotron* - This is basically just a visually cool main content starter. 
2. *The carousel* - This was a fun tool to play around with. The images rotate in at a speed you set. There are all kinds of tweaks I ended up making. The biggest thing I added here was wrapping it in a collapsable section. I cover this next
3. *Collapsing* - The carousel is pretty neat, but whoa does it take up some space. What I ended up doing was either navigating to another page or showing and hiding it.
4. *Grid Layout* - This was pretty darn neat once I got the hang of it. 
5. *Hiding* - I also used some bootstrap settings to hid the carousel on smaller screens.
6. *Footstop* - I wanted to have a floating nav that only showed when the user scroll down. I was able to utilize some javascript from stackoverflow (cited in html). I call it a footstop.

Minimize the use of media queries.

*I really did not add too much to the boiler plate bootstrap. There are about 8, which I figure is ok.*

Have valid and correct HTML.

*I used lighthouse validation tool available in the DOM.*
