<p>The goal of this assignment was to build a fully responsive website consisting of 3 pages that each had a nav bar, utilized a responsive layout with responsive images. Below is a review of requirements and how I tackled each.</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>Using the following three pages, build a portfolio site. <code>index.html</code>, <code>portfolio.html</code> and <code>contact.html</code>.</p>
<p><em>I started with the index page and worked element by element on down until I had something that worked for me. The design was clean and once the various videos and reading began to sink in - I began to enjoy it.</em></p>
<p><em>The most helpful video I found was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cKsq14Kfsw*">from Drew Ryan</a>. You can see that I included a lot of the elements he did adding and subtracting a few.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items: A navbar, A responsive layout, Responsive images</p>
<p><em>There were a couple of really cool things I got to learn about here.</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>The jumbotron</em> - This is basically just a visually cool main content starter.</li>
<li><em>The carousel</em> - This was a fun tool to play around with. The images rotate in at a speed you set. There are all kinds of tweaks I ended up making. The biggest thing I added here was wrapping it in a collapsable section. I cover this next</li>
<li><em>Collapsing</em> - The carousel is pretty neat, but whoa does it take up some space. What I ended up doing was either navigating to another page or showing and hiding it.</li>
<li><em>Grid Layout</em> - This was pretty darn neat once I got the hang of it.</li>
<li><em>Hiding</em> - I also used some bootstrap settings to hid the carousel on smaller screens.</li>
<li><em>Footstop</em> - I wanted to have a floating nav that only showed when the user scroll down. I was able to utilize some javascript from stackoverflow (cited in html). I call it a footstop.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Minimize the use of media queries.</p>
<p><em>I really did not add too much to the boiler plate bootstrap. There are about 8, which I figure is ok.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Have valid and correct HTML.</p>
<p><em>I used lighthouse validation tool available in the DOM.</em></p>
